# Water-Potability_Classification_Model
Although the our planet is majorly covered by water. Clean drinking water is still not available to masses, as only a small percentage of water is potable. As technology has developed, the advent of sensors that have the capability to measure the pollutants, minerals, and other characteristics of water it is possible to determine the potability of water. But this is not easy, as large amounts of data has to be analysed against the many parameters of water in order to determine if it is safe to drink.

Therefore, the proposed solution is to train a Machine Learning Model to classify the body of water as potable or not potable by weighing its dependency on the parameters related to water bodies. This allows water parameter data collected by the sensors to be inputs into the model and the model can classify whether it is safe to drink or not. It opens up the opportunity to work in real-time rather than delayed analysis.
